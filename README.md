## Overview

HOLD is a bitcoin and other cryptocurrency portfolio tracker app. It lets users login or register and add the investments they made in different coins. It then tracks the profit/loss since the time of purchase. Users can see the total current value of their investments in USD, analyse how they have diversified the portfolio (remember to not put all the eggs in one basket) and check latest trends and market analysis.

HOLD helps solve the problem of people having to manually do the complex calculations for their investments. It does that for them.
